# Topic modeling in LDA, Dynamic LDA:   
> This is a project of building a LDA (& dynamic LDA) model to cluster topics in Covid-19 dataset.  
  
> Covid-19 dataset: Covid-19 related articles from [@PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). (Until 01/Aug/2020)  
> Goal: Cluster topics and subtopics in Covid-19 dataset to find the hidden semantic structure.  
> Futurework: Dynamic, embedding, dynamic embedding, integration with supervised learning, summarization.
